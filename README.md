It captures the system info and stores it into a file and then hides that file into another files ads which was also created
through this virus and sends both of them to a sftp server. Then the virus downloads an image from the sftp server and hides
it into the ads of a batch file created on the desktop and runs the batch file which displays the image and also at the end
a pop up is shown of all the information gethered

# How to Run

An Executable file has been provided in the files which can be used to execute the virus, but the server will not run as
