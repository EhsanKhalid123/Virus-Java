# Virus-Java

A small virus program designed in Java, which executes the browser and displays a website and also stores all system info
It captures the system info and stores it into a file and then hides that file into another files ads which was also created
through this virus and sends both of them to a sftp server. Then the virus downloads an image from the sftp server and hides
it into the ads of a batch file created on the desktop and runs the batch file which displays the image and also at the end
a pop-up is shown of all the information gathered

# How to Run

An Executable file has been provided in the files which can be used to execute the virus, but the server will not run as
it is a local-based server. You can change the server in the code to yours and then compile the program and convert it to an exe file.
